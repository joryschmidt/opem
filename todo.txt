integrate XSRF security with angular $http

finish web views
create a few more events, get them with angular controllers, display them with ng-repeat, and minmax a responsive grid system
create routes to add and remove users from events and events from users
add signup date field to form

add venue field to form

mobile views
google maps api

Need designs for:
- view of a single event
- guest views
- date for signup window

- events should have a quick signup option for logged in users, either in view or on card






Spot model may be unnecessary 
make use of Date.prototype.toLocaleDateString() when dealing with dates, or find a good library

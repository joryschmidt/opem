integrate XSRF security with angular $http and helmetjs
finish web views
create routes to add and remove events from users
add .catch error routing for axios
integrate database login, signup, event creation errors into popup notifications
implement hamburger icon animation
remove date input placeholder at laptop level
form validations
change location field to address and venue fields
google maps autocomplete address

- events should have a quick signup option for logged in users, either in view or on card

recurring checkbox needs to be more specifc, or specifically for weekly events only
form needs to have seperate fields for venue and address


Spot model may be unnecessary 

- automatic login after signup

Currently, geocode is added to event when the event is first viewed in order to avoid relying on the google api when first saving the event to the database.
  Perhaps this can be done instead of, or in addition to, a regular database crawl for updating recurring events

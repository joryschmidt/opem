- events should have a quick signup option for logged in users, either in view or on card

recurring checkbox needs to be more specifc, or specifically for weekly events only


Spot model may be unnecessary 

- automatic login after signup

Currently, geocode is added to event when the event is first viewed in order to avoid relying on the google api when first saving the event to the database.
  Perhaps this can be done instead of, or in addition to, a regular database crawl for updating recurring events
